summary: What should Maths Tuition focus on?
---

<span style={{ color: 'red' }}>
  After the joy of summer, the busy and exiting first weeks of September are upon us. It’s that time
  when many children are being signed up for extra tuition, whether to prepare them for exams or to
  give them some extra support or a headstart on a challenging subject – which very often happens to
  be maths!
</span>

<p>
  The high demand for maths tuition is not surprising. Maths is one of the most important school
  subjects. Indeed, giving a child a good maths education is a valuable investment in their future.
  But what is a <b>good maths education</b>? And what is good maths tuition?
</p>

<p>
  All learning activities, including maths lessons, should be designed to stimulate a child’s
  cognitive development. Thus, an hour spent on solving problems is much more beneficial for a child
  than an hour spent on practicing calculation techniques. However, even an excellent maths teacher
  might fail to organise stimulating lessons in a large class of children with a range of abilities
  and diverse backgrounds. The benefit of private maths tuition is that it can be organised in small
  compatible groups or individually.
</p>

<p>
  An individual approach works wonders for children who struggle with mathematics. Alarmingly, this
  is the most substantial cohort of school-age children. I believe that the difficulties which so
  many children experience when learning maths have nothing to do with their cognitive abilities or
  the lack of a ‘maths gene’, but rather are the consequences of failing provisions for maths
  education.
</p>

<p>
  If a child has already had a negative experience studying mathematics at school, the after-school
  tutoring should be very gentle. Negative emotions associated with maths lessons could be
  extrapolated by a child to the subject of mathematics itself. It’s important that your tutor
  starts with the most basic exercises, then slowly and methodically builds the topics up. If a
  child gets stressed or drained, it is better to take a break and restart. Good maths tuition is
  not about drilling children on ‘challenging’ topics, but about helping them to develop
  self-confidence and enjoy maths.
</p>

<p>
  With the correct support, children normally succeed at school mathematics, while a good maths
  tutor should be able to help a gifted child to develop their abilities even further. It does not
  mean that a Year 4 student should be given Year 6 questions to practice – which unfortunately most
  often is the case, and is a waste of time and talent. Instead, able children should be encouraged
  to work on age-appropriate problems which require a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts,
  for example problems from maths competitions, such as <i>Kangaroo</i> or{' '}
  <i>UK Maths Challenges</i>.
</p>

<p>
  The demand for maths tuition has created an enormous market. However, the most beneficial maths
  lessons are those on which children are able to explore mathematical ideas, and are encouraged to
  use their creativity to combine these ideas to solve problems. Such lessons are worthy investments
  in a child’s development, and are representative of a world-class mathematical education.
